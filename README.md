From the university to the business. Communication Lab, or CommLab, has been on a mission towards comprehensibility since 2006. We are rooted in research: within the framework of our experience as
communication researchers, we have developed measures for comprehensibility and our software, TextLab. Since we began this journey, weâ€™ve been successfully supporting businesses and agencies in making their communication more clear and effective.

Clear text and communicators: Our team. Our knowledge is not just collecting dust in scientific archives. We choose to put our know-how into practice. Our backgrounds are diverse, but we all have the same goal: clear text.
